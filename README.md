## README

Multi-Task aims to exploit the basic methodology for to-do lists implemented by the .taskpaper format, as supplemented by the [PlainTasks plugin for the Sublime Text editor, written by Allen Barghi](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks).

The goal, ultimately, is to have a single directory of .taskpaper files in a user's Dropbox account, which the user can edit anywhere s/he can get to a computer:

- Editing through a Ruby on Rails application (the code under development here)
- Editing through an iOS application to be developed after the web infastructure is complete
- Editing through a text editor of his/her choice (granted, Sublime Text will have a huge edge in usability here, due to the extensions created by the PlainTasks plugin)
